# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r echo=TRUE}
df<-read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo=TRUE}
dates <- levels(df$date)
res <- numeric()
for (i in 1:length(dates)) {
  res[i] <- sum(df[df$date==dates[i],"steps"])
}
hist(res, main="Total number of steps per day", xlab="steps")
mean(res, na.rm=TRUE)
median(res, na.rm=TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
